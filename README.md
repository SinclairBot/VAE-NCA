> <cite> Image Generation With Neural Cellular Automatas [arxiv link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.04949)</cite>

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to generate images (or other artworks) by using neural cellular automatas (NCAs). Rather than training NCAs based on single images one by one, we combined the idea of variational autoencoders (VAEs), and hence explored some applications, such as image restoration and style fusion.
